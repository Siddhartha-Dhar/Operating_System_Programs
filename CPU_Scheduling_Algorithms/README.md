# CPU_Scheduling_Algorithms
All the basics CPU Scheduling algorithms (e.g. FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR, HRRN, Priority, Multilevel Feedback Queue)

**Language Used is C++**

## List of Algorithms Covered

* FCFS (First Come First Serve) (Non-Preemptive)
* SJF (Shortest Job First) (Non-Preemptive)
* Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
* HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next) (Non-Preemptive)
* SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) (Preemptive)
* RR (Round Robin) (Preemptive)
* Multillevel Feedback Queue (Total 3 queues, First two uses RR and the last one uses FCFS)

## Features of the algorithms

* Prints the Process table (the given inputs)
* Prints the Gnatt Chart with the CPU-Idle time if any
* Prints the Output Process table (with Completion, Turn-Around, and Waiting times )
* Covers all the Corner Cases
